Guidelines for Pair-Programming
The driver is the person who is at the keyboard and mouse
The navigator is the person who is thinking out loud, actively collaborating with the driver about the next step, and helping guide the development
Trade-off driver and navigator roles often
Take time to make sure you're on the same page
